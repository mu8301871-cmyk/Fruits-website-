    <h1>Pineapple</h1>
    <hr>
    <pr>A pineapple is a tropical fruit with a tough, scaly exterior and sweet, juicy yellow flesh. It is the most economically significant plant in the Bromeliaceae family, originating from South America and known for its crown of leaves. Pineapples are a good source of vitamin C, antioxidants, and manganese, and they contain an enzyme called bromelain, which has anti-inflammatory properties and can help tenderize meat.
