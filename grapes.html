    <h1>Grapes!</h1>
    <hr>
    <pr>Grapes are a type of fruit, botanically a berry, that grows on woody vines in clusters. They can be eaten fresh or used to make products like raisins, juice, jam, and wine. Ranging in color from green to red and purple, grapes are known for their health benefits, primarily due to their antioxidant and nutrient content. 
Characteristics
Growth: Grapes grow in clusters on deciduous woody vines of the genus Vitis.
Appearance: They are small, oval fruits that can be green, red, purple, or black. They have a thin skin and juicy flesh, and can be either seeded or seedless.
Variety: There are thousands of varieties, differing in color, size, shape, and ripening time. 
Uses
Consumption: Eaten fresh as a snack, used in salads, or frozen for a cool treat.
Products: Processed into products like raisins, juice, jam, jelly, vinegar, and wine.
Other: Grape seeds are used to create grape seed extract and oil. 
Health and nutrition
Nutrients: Grapes are a good source of vitamin C, vitamin K, and minerals like potassium, calcium, and phosphorus.
Antioxidants: They are rich in antioxidants, such as flavonoids and polyphenols, which may help protect against cellular damage.
Potential benefits: The antioxidants and nutrients in grapes may support heart health, immune function, and bone health, although more research is needed for some of these claims.
Low-calorie: With about 69 calories per 100 grams, they can be a good option for a healthy diet. 
Important considerations
Excess consumption: Eating too many grapes can lead to unintended weight gain or gastrointestinal issues due to their sugar and fiber content.
Allergies: Some people may have a grape allergy.
Distinction: Grapes are not the same as grapefruit.
